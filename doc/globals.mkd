Globals
=======

Kerbulator aims to supply the user to all readings provided by the various
instruments in the cockpit and the map view of vanilla KSP. I feel it strikes a
good balance between giving not to little and not too much precalculated
information. This balance is important to keep the game fun.

This document describes the various variables that are defined as 'global',
meaning you can use them in any function without having to initialize them
yourself. You can however at any point in your function overwrite them with
your own value and they will keep this value for the remainder of the current
function (but not in other functions: the scope is local.) For example,
Kerbulator provides the mass of the planet you are currently orbiting:

    out: x "The original value of Parent.M"
	out: y "A new value for Parent.M"

    x = Parent.M # The mass of the parent body we're orbiting
	Parent.M = 10 # Overwrite the value with our own
	y = Parent.M

### Information about various orbits

Kerbulator has globals that correspond to all the information KSP gives the
player about orbits for the following bodies. In the table below, replace {body} with
the name of the body you wish to obtain information about.
